# Gonad-MRI_SegAI
## Overview 
This repository describes an AI model to run on MR images to segment GONADS and ovarian cysts. 
## Introducing Gonad-MRI_SegAI :rocket:
This repository is created to release the model weights for the following abstract: "AI-based Approach for Automated Gonad Volume Quantification Using MRI in Healthy Adolescents across Puberty".
Please cite if you are using the model: ***coming soon***
## Installation and prerequisites
First clone the repo and cd into the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/HFahmida/Gonad-MRI_SegAI.git
cd Gonad-MRI_SegAI
```
Then create a conda env and install the dependencies:
```
conda create -n mri_gonad python=3.10 -y
conda activate mri_gonad
```
Install nnUNet. Installation process can be found in the following link: [documentation/installation_instructions.md](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/installation_instructions.md)

## How to use
### Data Preparation

Image file should be in nifti format. Use the **dicom_to_nifti_conversion.py** file to convert dicom images
```
python dicom_to_nifti_conversion.py [--dicom_path dicom_folder] [--nifti_path nifti-outpath]
```
nnU-Net expects datasets in a structured format. This format is inspired by the data structure of the Medical Segmentation Decthlon. Please read the following link for dataset conversion: [how-to-use-nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/blob/master/documentation/how_to_use_nnunet.md)

For duel modality (FS-T2W and T2W AI model), FS T2W MRIs should be renamed as channel 1 input with ***'_0000.nii.gz'*** extension and T2W MRIs ***'_0001.nii.gz'***. Example FS-T2W image: ***id-023_2014-09_0000.nii.gz***, T2W Image: ***id-023_2014-09_0001.nii.gz***

For single modality (FS-T2W AI or T2W AI model), both MRIs should be renamed as channel 1 input individually with ***'_0000.nii.gz'*** extension. Example FS-T2W image: ***id-023_2014-09_0000.nii.gz*** for FS T2W only AI, T2W Image: ***id-023_2014-09_0000.nii.gz*** for T2W only AI

## Inference
### Model weights
Download the Pretrained model checkpoints and Images from the following link: [Gonad-MRI_SegAI](https://zenodo.org/records/16414788)

Unzip the file and put them inside **Gonad-MRI_SegAI/** folder. We have provided scripts for running inference. 

### For Ovary and Cyst Segmentation model: 

**Dataset101_MRI-Ovary-Cyst:** FS-T2W and T2W MRI [T2W image is resampled to FS T2W image size and spacing] used to train the model

**Dataset102_MRI-Ovary-Cyst:** FS-T2W MRI used to train the model

**Dataset103_MRI-Ovary-Cyst:** T2W MRI used to train the model

```
sbatch inference_Ovary-Cyst_AI_model.sh 

```

Once the model inference was completed, use the following two scripts to extract statistics and volumes in comparison to ground truth. Fix the folder paths according to yours. 

```
python Ovary-Cyst_AI_statistics.py

python Ovary-cyst_volume_extraction.py
```

### For testicle Segmentation model: 

**Dataset101_MRI-testie:** Testicular Whole model trained using T2W MRI

**Dataset102_MRI-testie:** Testicular side-separated model trained using T2W MRI

```
sbatch inference_Testicular_AI_model.sh 

```

Once the model inference was completed, use the following two scripts to extract statistics and volumes in comparison to ground truth. Fix the folder paths according to yours. 

```
python Testicular_AI_statistics.py

python Testicular_AI_volume_extraction.py
```
